# E2E tests

The E2E tests run against local deployments of the parachain, relayer and ganache.

## Requirements

1. Development environment for Rust and Substrate. See parachain [requirements](../parachain/README.md#requirements).
2. Make sure you use a recent node version, e. g. with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating):

  ```bash
  nvm install 14.16.1
  nvm use 14.16.1
  ```

3. Development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.

  ```bash
  yarn global add truffle
  (cd ../ethereum && yarn install)
  cp env.template .env
  ```

4. Development environment for Relayer. See relayer [requirements](../relayer/README.md#development).
5. `timeout` - native package on Ubuntu, on macOS try ```brew install coreutils```
6. `jq` - https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/
7. Build the `@snowfork/snowbridge-types` package using these [steps](../types/README.md#development).

## Setup

Make sure to install/build all the requirements above.

Download dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Install `polkadot-launch`:

```bash
git clone -n https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-launch.git /tmp/polkadot-launch
cd /tmp/polkadot-launch
git checkout 89e970
yarn install
yarn build
yarn global add file:$(pwd)
cd -
```

Build polkadot:

```bash
git clone -n https://github.com/snowfork/polkadot.git /tmp/polkadot
cd /tmp/polkadot
git checkout enable_beefy_on_rococo
cargo build --release
cd -
```

Optional: If you cloned the polkadot repo in another location, Create an `.env` file to specify the directory where you installed the polkadot binary.

```bash
cp ./.env-example .env
```

Start all services (parachain, relayer, ganache, etc). We recommend adding the `duplicate` flag to create a duplicate parachain so that we have 2 different running and registered parachains for testing XCM and for testing the polkadot light client with multiple parachain headers being tracked.

```bash
scripts/start-services.sh duplicate
```

Wait until the "System has been initialized" message

Go to polkadot-js and wait until the parachain has started producing blocks:
https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A11144#/explorer

You can see the relay chain by connecting to https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9955#/explorer

Confirm the block number is > 2

You should now be good to go!

## Run Tests

### Integration Tests

```bash
yarn test
```

### Testing against a malicious contract
We also have a test environment that tests against a malicious contract that attempts to consume infinite gas. To setup this environment, run the start-services script with the malicious flag:

```bash
scripts/start-services.sh malicious
```

This will deploy and run everything as usual, but replace the erc20 app with a malicious one. Once everything is ready to go, run the tests again

```bash
yarn test
```

You should see the erc20 tests failing, due to the malicious app, but the eth and dot app tests should pass successfully without being impacted.

### Manual Tests

Make sure to setup the E2E stack as described above.

For interacting with Substrate, open [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A11144#/explorer) in your browser (Make sure to use this link specifically).

#### Locking up ETH to mint PolkaETH on Substrate

Send 10 Ether to `//Alice` on Substrate:

```bash
cd ../ethereum
truffle exec scripts/sendEth.js 10 \
  0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d \
  --network e2e_test
```

It should take around 10-20 seconds for Substrate to receive and process the message.

In the substrate webapp (linked above), you should see an `Eth.Minted` event in the Network > Explorer view.

#### Burning PolkaETH to unlock ETH on Ethereum

To see the PolkaETH balance for `//Alice`:

1. Navigate to Developer > Chain state > Storage
2. Select the `assets` module in the drop-down.
3. Select `ETH` as the AssetId
4. Select `Alice` as the AccountId
5. Click the `+` button

To burn PolkaETH and unlock ETH on Ethereum:

1. Navigate to Developer > Extrinsics
2. Select `Alice` as the AccountId
3. Select `eth` as the module, and `burn` as the extrinsic
4. Select `Basic` for the ChannelId
5. Input `0xBe68fC2d8249eb60bfCf0e71D5A0d2F2e292c4eD` for the recipient
6. Input `10000000000000000000` for the amount

![Viewing the account balance for Alice](docs/burn-polkaeth.jpeg)

It should take around 20 seconds for Ethereum to receive and process the message.

To verify that `0xBe68fC2d8249eb60bfCf0e71D5A0d2F2e292c4eD` received 10 Ether:

```bash
cd ../ethereum
truffle exec scripts/getEthBalance.js 0xBe68fC2d8249eb60bfCf0e71D5A0d2F2e292c4eD --network e2e_test
```

## Debugging

The `start-services.sh` script writes the following logs:

- parachain.log
- relayer.log
- ganache.log
